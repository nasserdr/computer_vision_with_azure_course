# Computer Vision with Azure Workshop
## Agroscope - Liebefield (13, 15 and 16 December 2022).
The goal from this workshop is to give you the starting point tools to implement computer vision projects on real dataset. We will focus on:
* Object detection
* Semantic segmentation
* Azure Machine Learning
* Computer Vision in Production

# Before you Begin: 
* Create a workspace on AzureML with the following naming `<site>_<group>_<first_last_name>`
* Once your workspace is created, create a compute instance: `Standard_NC8as_T4_v3`
* Inside your workspace, go to Notebooks, open a terminal and clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/nasserdr/computer_vision_with_azure_course`

# Program Details:
* Day 1 (13 December): 
  *08h30 - 09h00: Introduction
  *09h00 - 12h00: Object Detection using FasterRcnn (hourly: 50 min + 10 min breaks).
  *12h00 - 13h00: Lunch break
  *13h00 - 16h00: Semantic Segmentation (hourly: 50 min + 10 min breaks).
* Day 2 (15 December): 
    *09h00 - 12h00: Azure Machine Learning Part 1.
    *12h00 - 13h00: Lunch break
    *13h00 - 16h00: Azure Machine Learning Part 2.
* Day 3 (16 December): 
    *09h00 - 12h00: Machine Learning and Computer Vision in production / MLOps
    *12h00 - 13h00: Lunch break
    *13h00 - 15h00: Discussion about future synchronization between Agroscope Researchers regarding the computer vision projects, knowledge exchange, expertise sharing, future events.
